Job hunters often rely on recruiters and recruiting agencies to get interviews and secure freelance and full-time job placement. At the same time, there is not a go-to resource that ranks recruiting agencies based on user reviews and ratings. Recruiter Review aims to solve this problem by letting users see and write reviews on the various agencies that exist.

####Project Requirements

- This Rails app uses 3 models: agency, user, and review. RESTful routes are used as users can currently GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE reviews.

####Technology Used

Ruby

Ruby on Rails

Postgresql

jQuery

Html/CSS

Bootstrap


####How To
Traversing the website is easy.  Users can see agencies on the homepage and see the agency avg rating and description.  Users can search for agencies in the search bar.  By clicking on an agency, users can write reviews and see user reviews of the agency.  Users can sign-up and log-in to keep track of, edit, and/or delete their reviews.

####Phase 2 - Iterations

In the next phase, I aim to create more agencies possible to review, a possible glassdoor API to access even more agencies, and more search bars to search agencies by location.
